				Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons.With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.

				Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,and no. 5 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.In 1997, the episode "The One with the Prom Video" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time,and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time.The sitcom's cast members returned for a reunion special aired on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.

				Although the producers thought of Friends as "only a TV show", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of Friends during the series's run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "The Rachel" and copied around the world.Joey's catchphrase, "How you doin'?", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word "so" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change.Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.
			<p>
				Readers of TV Guide voted the cast of Friends their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating Seinfeld, which registered 18%.A poll undertaken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair named Friends the third greatest sitcom of all time.In 2014, the series was ranked by Mundo Estranho the Best TV Series of All Time.A 2015 survey by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named Friends as their No. 1 favorite show.
