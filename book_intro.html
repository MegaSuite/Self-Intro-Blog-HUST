				From the beginning, One Hundred Years of Solitude hints at the reincarnation of the fate of an entire family, namely that each generation of the family repeats in a different way the same tragedy of its ancestors. Not only are the names repeated, but also, when Colonel Buendia makes the full 20 little goldfish in the first place and melts down to make them again ...... the non-stop cycle suggests the doomed end of the Buendia family, namely the union of the sixth generation, Aureliano, with his aunt Amaranda Ursula and the birth of pig-tailed offspring bearing the mark of an inbred marriage, a mythical creature that ended an entire family, as if back in the beginning.
			</p>
			<p>
				A century on, the town of Macondo is experiencing a similar fate. From its creation to the infiltration of Gypsy civilisation, to the wars caused by the intervention of political groups, to the invasion of foreign armed forces and their withdrawal, Macondo has suffered too many trials and tribulations. Prosperity is always followed by defeat. "The first of the family was tied to a tree and the last was being eaten by ants." It is the history of the Buendia family that is recorded in the parchment. The moment Aureliano finished translating the last chapter, a sudden hurricane wiped away the whole of Macondo, gone forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through One Hundred Years of Solitude, it was as if I had seen the inner world of the author, Márquez. He is a pessimist, yet a realist. The mind in rationality also takes flight. Colouring immortal dreams is not his only expression. He portrays in different ways the dystopian re-enactment of the history of his native Colombia, and even of Latin America.
			</p>
			<p>
				One Hundred Years of Solitude is the most finely described and penetratingly written work of fiction I have ever read. I have to say, the fifteen years of work that Márquez put into this magnum opus is perfect! At the moment I finished enjoying this feast of words, I felt endless emotions and lamentations, and at the same time, I gained some inspiration. Loneliness, the invisible veneer, we always fail to see it. It is originally a walker in the inner world, and communication is the constant bridge. We can be alone, it has always been there, whether it is a hundred years, or a thousand years, only may it brighten up.
